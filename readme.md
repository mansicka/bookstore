# Bookstore app
This is a simple excercise project written to gain knowledge on building a simple CRUD REST API. The UI is a rudimentary placeholder React project to serve as a simple testing plattform for the API. 

## Requirements
 - Node.js and a web browser
 
## Installation

For automated installation:

A bash script is included to automate the installation process. To run the installation, first make the script file executable:

    chmod u+x install

Then run the installation script:

    ./install

After this, you need to configure your database enviroment for the backend. To do this, see included .env.example file in /backend directory. Edit this file and save with a filename of ".env". 


Non-bash users should run *npm install* in both frontend and backend directories, as no automated installationg script is provided for such enviroments.

## Starting the app

To start both the front and backend, run **npm start** in the project root directory.
